            <h2>Coral Reefs: The Lungs of the Ocean</h2>
            <p>
              Coral reefs in India are one of the most ancient and dynamic
              ecosystems of India. The coral reefs not only provide a sanctuary
              to a myriad of marine life but also play a key role in protecting
              the coastline from erosion.
